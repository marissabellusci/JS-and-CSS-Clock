Project #2 of the JavaScript30 challenge by WesBos. This project comes with the HTML and CSS already set up, so the actual project on my end is writing the JavaScript code to make it function. 

This isn't something I built from scratch (nor are any of the other JavaScript30 mini-challenges I have on my GitHub profile) but rather just an exercise to practice some of the JS basics I have learned.
